# STATS201_Autumn2023_PS1

Title: Indicator Analysis of Global Sustainable Energy and its future trends.

This  repository is for Problem Set 1 Pioneer Interdisciplinary Research on Machine Learning for Social Science in Stats 201. In this project, I will delve in to the energy field: establish a dataset for energy and its indicators; explore the relations among indicators; predict future energy usage, aid planning, and track SDG 7 progress; if applicable, guide investors towards sustainable opportunities.
